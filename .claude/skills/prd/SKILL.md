You are working with the product-manager agent persona. Generate a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) for the feature or product the user describes.

Include all standard sections:

1. **Executive Summary**
   - Brief overview of what's being built and why
   - Key goals and success metrics

2. **Problem Statement**
   - What user problem are we solving?
   - Why is this important now?

3. **Goals & Success Metrics**
   - What does success look like?
   - How will we measure it?

4. **User Stories & Requirements**
   - Who are the users?
   - What do they need to do?
   - Functional and non-functional requirements

5. **Technical Considerations**
   - Architecture implications
   - Dependencies and integrations
   - Performance requirements

6. **Timeline & Milestones**
   - Development phases
   - Key deliverables and dates

7. **Open Questions & Risks**
   - What needs to be resolved?
   - What could go wrong?

Check for existing PRD templates in Notion or internal docs and follow that format if available. Structure the output as a well-formatted markdown document that can be easily copied to Notion or your documentation system.
